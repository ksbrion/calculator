This calculator project is part of The Odin Project Foundations Curriculum.

The calculator design and functionality was inspired by the default calculator app of my phone. With this, I did my best to copy the functionalities that are present in my phone's calculator.

The project is still work in progress and I was hoping to be able to implement the same functionalities with a much precise/cleaner code. Hopefully, I would be able to improve my coding skills to shorten/simplify the codes/function that I have used in this project.

In order to make the calculator work, I have included 'Indicators' which are stored in various variables with the values 0 or 1. These indicators allow the calculator to operate for the following scenarios:
1. Indicator to let the calculator initiate a screen clear upon input of the second Number for the operation.
2. Indicator to let the calculator initiate an operation when an operator is clicked instead of a the equal sign. ex. 12 + 7 - 5 * 3 = 42
3. Indicator to let the calculator initiante an operation even when the equal sign is pressed more than once. ex. 1+1 = = = should be equal 4. Indicator to avoid the calculator to input more than one decimal point for a number; and prepend the number with "0" whenever necessary.
